Description: GNU R scripting and command-line front-end
 The 'r' (aka 'littler') program provides a lightweight binary wrapper around 
 the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
 .
 While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
 both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hashmark-exclamation-path 
 expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in 
 standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without 
 the environment.
